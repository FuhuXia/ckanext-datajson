    "description": "This project is to determine horizontal and vertical movement patterns of two jellyfish species in Hood Canal, in relation to environmental variables. It is being conducted by NMFS scientists in collaboration with a NOAA Hollings Scholar; we also are making use of publicly available oceanographic data from the University of Washington. We used acoustic tags and receivers to track jellyfish movement patterns and correlated their movements with oceanographic data. This project will produce peer reviewed manuscripts. The target audience is fisheries and marine resource managers in Puget Sound and along the West Coast. This is a one-time, standalone project without a firm deadline.\nThis data set contains acoustic telemetry data for lions mane and fried egg jellyfish.",
